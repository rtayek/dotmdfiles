Goal:
Design a workflow that extracts durable semantic state from a completed chat and uses it to bootstrap a fresh lower-level operational chat.

Current ideas:
- Git stores chronology/history.
- Markdown stores compressed semantic state.
- JSON stores orchestration/schemas/routing.
- Canonical docs should remain small and focused.
- Most historical reasoning should not be preserved in markdown.
- Context should be reconstructed fresh per task.

Focus:
- concrete extraction pipeline
- file formats
- working-context design
- prompt assembly
- post-task harvesting

Out of scope:
- broad harness philosophy
- large-scale agent orchestration
- multi-agent systems

Immediate task:
Produce the first concrete version of the extraction workflow, including exact output files and a minimal template for each.
